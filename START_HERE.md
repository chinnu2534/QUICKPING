# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Guide

## The Problem
The features aren't showing in your browser because of **cached files**.

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Restart the Server
```bash
# Stop if running (Ctrl+C)
cd /tmp/cc-agent/59298112/project/chat_app
cargo run
```

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
**Do NOT just press F5 or click refresh!**

**Windows/Linux:**
- Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Mac:**
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`

This forces the browser to reload all files from the server instead of using cached versions.

### Step 3: Check Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for this message:
   ```
   === FEATURE CHECK ===
   Search input: FOUND
   Search button: FOUND
   Search results: FOUND
   ====================
   ```

If you see "FOUND" for all three → **Features are loaded!** ✅

## 🧪 Quick Test Without Running Full App

Open this file in your browser directly:
```
/tmp/cc-agent/59298112/project/chat_app/static/test_features.html
```

Or:
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/59298112/project/chat_app/static
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/test_features.html
```

This test page shows if the CSS and HTML features work.

## 📍 Where to Find Features (After Loading)
