# Chat Application Improvements

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Chess Board Visibility Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: When opening the chess game, the bottom part of the board was cut off and not fully visible.

**Solution**:
- Changed game modal layout to use `flexbox` centering with proper overflow handling
- Updated `.game-modal-content` to allow vertical scrolling with `max-height: 95vh`
- Modified `.game-container` to use `justify-content: flex-start` and enable `overflow-y: auto`
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to `.chess-board` to prevent compression
- Increased bottom margin on chess board from `20px` to `40px` for better visibility
- Changed chess board `overflow` from `hidden` to `visible`
- Added responsive padding adjustments for different screen sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `/static/index.html` - CSS styles for game modal and chess board

**Result**: The chess board is now fully visible on all screen sizes, with proper scrolling if needed. The bottom rows are no longer cut off.
